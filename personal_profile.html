<p>This was a very interesting test for me, I have never done one of these before. <br>
  The 16personalities test (Free personality test, type descriptions, relationship <br>
  and career advice | 16Personalities, 2021), I found was very accurate with a few <br>
  exceptions, but I understand that everyone is different. I would normally put this <br>
  kind of psych review based on an online questionnaire in the same category as star signs, <br>
  in that there cannot be enough to determine who I am. Although I feel that the 16 <br>
  Personalities test was close. For the learning style assessment <br>
  (How-To-Study.com and SOAR Learning, 2021), I have done one of these before when I <br>
  was in high school and was struggeling with the work load. I also got Visual learner <br>
  on the test then as well and felt that buy drawing or watching videos online with <br>
  subtitle and annotations that it helped me heaps. The big five personality test I took <br>
  (The Big Five Personality Test, 2021), really feels like an impossibility and unusable information. <br>
  It feels like having %60 openness is an odd way to describe a trait when all the other <br>
  components donâ€™t make up a total of 100%, like this is telling me the I am %298 in total <br>
  personality traits.</p>

  <p>I do feel that the 16 personalities test or big five personalities test will influence <br>
    how I interact with a team in any way. I do not hold weight to these online quizzes any <br>
    more than a BuzzFeed online test to see what kind of garlic bread I am. Working in group <br>
    assignments in the past has shown that the best way to work in a group is to discuss who <br>
    is doing what components and making sure all parts a equal and if a group member is failing <br>
    to contribute their part at all to remove them from the group. The learning style assessment <br>
    test I do feel is helpful because it reinforces what an in person discussion with the psychologist <br>
    has already told me. This information will be useful when completing my components in the <br>
    assignment to make sure I write everything out in diagrams or dot-points.</p>
