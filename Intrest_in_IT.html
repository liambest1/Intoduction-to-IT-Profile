    My real interest in Information Technology didn’t start until I was 20 in my second year of university<br>
       when I went to a friend's house to study and he was showing me the PC he had built. After that, I had become<br>
        obsessed with building my own, every night I watch PC building tutorials or reading forums on parts and advice. <br>
        After I got my first role as an IT professional I became fascinated by the network administration component <br>
        whether it was user administration in Active Directory or building and establishing and new server. <br>
        I have always had a curiosity for programming but without the structure of a formal lesson found it difficult<br>
         to motivate myself to learn. I enjoy working face to face with people and moving around during<br>
          the day so my role as onsite Technical support has been well suited to me.

    <p>My friend in my first year of university was the first influence I had on the world of Information Technology,<br>
       before that I had only used a computer as a standard user with the most technical use was torrenting<br>
        (open-source software of course). After finally saving to build my own PC I didn’t do much else in regards to IT<br>
         for another year. I owe my start in IT to my step-dad who is a client manager in IT, my first job in IT was offered <br>
         to me by him at the Manage Service Provider he worked at. In this role, I was a self-employed contractor doing a <br>
         company-wide roll-out of new laptops for REA Group (Realestate.com) using images pre-made and using PXE boot to <br>
         install them. this was my first taste of professional IT. That role only lasted 4 months but was enough to impress <br>
         the boss and I was offered a role of level 1 service desk operator for several remote clients and 2 days a week <br>
         onsite assistance to one client located in far rural Victoria. In this job, I did a variety of work from managing <br>
         site backups to replacing broken keyboards. After this, I got my job now at the Moonee Valley Racing Club where I <br>
         provide almost 24-hour support to the staff at the club, 3 gaming venues as well as point of sale network assistance <br>
         at the Melbourne Show Grounds. My current role has slowly become a level 1 and 2 role as I do more work building and <br>
         implementing servers, switches and the total implementation of multi-site monitoring software while still working with <br>
         staff to maintain business as usual tech support.</p>

    <p> I had applied to RMIT for several reasons. First, I got a recommendation from a current student who was also studying <br>
      online with RMIT and had a great experience with the learning style. After plenty of research, I knew I would have to study <br>
      online to make sure that I could manage full-time work and study part-time, this meant to me that Open Universities Australia <br>
      was the best path for applying and RMIT was available there. RMIT offers this robust course in Information Technology allowing <br>
      me to learn all the fundamentals that I have not been able to pick up with on the job learning,  along with minor subjects in <br>
      Management which I believe will be very useful in day-to-day operations. This course will also prepare in fields of IT that, <br>
      while I might not focus on, will allow me to start implementing it and be prepared when I do come across these issues, such as programming the security.
