<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
    <h2>IT Operations Manager</h2>
    <img src="https://github.com/liambest1/Intoduction-to-IT-Profile/blob/main/Ideal%20Job%20.png?raw=true" width="500" height="300"> <br><br>
    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53661696?type=standout#searchRequestToken=195e9622-a0a0-41c9-a132-1f7ea82b2c6c">IT Operations Manager as listed on Seek.com.au</a><br><br>


<p>This role is focused on ensuring that the IT team as a whole can fully function and<br>
     provide business as usual support. Beyond looking after the individuals in the IT team <br>
     it is also the responsibility of the IT Operations Manager to ensure that all IT hardware <br>
     is properly scoped, installed, and maintained with regards to both hardware and software. <br>
     This Role required the applicant to be able to effectively maintain relevant documentation, <br>
     including policies, procedures, budgets, Knowledge Bases and monitoring risk and compliance.
</p>

<p>This role strikes me as an ideal job mainly because this role requires a mix of high-level <br>
   technical skills while still engaging in face-to-face with subordinates, co-workers and 3rd <br>
   party vendors. While I don’t have this level of technical skill or management yet that this <br>
   is a completely achievable goal for the next 8-10 years.
</p>


  <p>This role requires strong technical knowledge and hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure, <br>
    Office 365, Cisco Meraki networking, VOIP telephony systems at an enterprise level as well as <br>
    experience with audiovisual systems and conferencing solutions. This role requires the applicant <br>
    to demonstrate skills in team management and clear communication. As with any management role <br>
    strong planning skills are required to help budget, meet deadlines and work autonomously both as <br>
    an individual and a team. I have a high-level understanding of how must servers functions from <br>
    domain controllers, print servers, SQL databases and storage systems.</p>

<p>I have been working in the IT industry for the last 4 years in a helpdesk support role. <br>
    These experiences include managing the entire rollout of 450 laptops to staff, this includes planning <br>
    and executing the PXE imaging process and cooperating with each user to do a handover. I have <br>
    experience in helpdesk job/ticket management through various applications. All my roles have had <br>
    face-to-face contact with users and upper management helping me develop my interpersonal skills and <br>
    patience. I have a strong understanding of most user-centered software and hardware, including desktop <br>
    applications and computer systems. I have hands-on experience with Office 365 in a hybrid environment with Azure. <br>
    I have been involved in the rollout of new Wi-Fi systems throughout the business. I have had first-hand <br>
    experience in producing a scope of works and installation of conferencing systems with hardware procurement <br>
    to software installation such as zoom and Microsoft Teams. I have had extensive experience in time management <br>
    with balancing long-term projects, like Windows 10 rollout, to everyday issues such as new keyboard and mouse. <br>
    I have experience in high-pressure situations. I have worked hands-on with Point-of-Sales systems with both hardware and software.
  </p>

  <p>Studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology is the first and most important step towards getting to this goal, <br>
    as this degree not only covers technical aspects of IT but also has minor subjects in management. <br>
    The position requires a degree in Technology and this course will take me roughly 5-6 years to complete. <br>
    In terms of experience while I have 4 years of level 1/2 helpdesk experience this won’t be enough to step <br>
    \into a management role, with my current employer I will start taking on smaller management roles like <br>
    planning and budgeting a new surveillance system with the help of my manager. To be better understand <br>
    best practices I will be enrolling in an ITIL class toward the end of this degree to ensure that I am <br>
    up to date. My current role has limitations both in the range of software used and size of the company <br>
    to prepare me for 1500+ users, as a result, I will have to move to a new company as a level 2 Technical <br>
    support with at least 500 users then after a few years move again to another company as a level 3 <br>
    technician with around 1000 users. Only after this will I be ready to take on the role of IT Operations Manager.</p>
