    IT Operations Manager
    https://www.seek.com.au/job/53661696?type=standout#searchRequestToken=195e9622-a0a0-41c9-a132-1f7ea82b2c6c



    This role is focused on ensuring that the IT team as a whole can fully function and provide business as usual support. Beyond looking after the individuals in the IT team it is also the responsibility of the IT Operations Manager to ensure that all IT hardware is properly scoped, installed, and maintained with regards to both hardware and software. This Role required the applicant to be able to effectively maintain relevant documentation, including policies, procedures, budgets, Knowledge Bases and monitoring risk and compliance.
    This role strikes me as an ideal job mainly because this role requires a mix of high-level technical skills while still engaging in face-to-face with subordinates, co-workers and 3rd party vendors. While I don’t have this level of technical skill or management yet that this is a completely achievable goal for the next 8-10 years.

    This role requires strong technical knowledge and hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Cisco Meraki networking, VOIP telephony systems at an enterprise level as well as experience with audiovisual systems and conferencing solutions. This role requires the applicant to demonstrate skills in team management and clear communication. As with any management role strong planning skills are required to help budget, meet deadlines and work autonomously both as an individual and a team. I have a high-level understanding of how must servers functions from domain controllers, print servers, SQL databases and storage systems.
    I have been working in the IT industry for the last 4 years in a helpdesk support role. These experiences include managing the entire rollout of 450 laptops to staff, this includes planning and executing the PXE imaging process and cooperating with each user to do a handover. I have experience in helpdesk job/ticket management through various applications. All my roles have had face-to-face contact with users and upper management helping me develop my interpersonal skills and patience. I have a strong understanding of most user-centered software and hardware, including desktop applications and computer systems. I have hands-on experience with Office 365 in a hybrid environment with Azure. I have been involved in the rollout of new Wi-Fi systems throughout the business. I have had first-hand experience in producing a scope of works and installation of conferencing systems with hardware procurement to software installation such as zoom and Microsoft Teams. I have had extensive experience in time management with balancing long-term projects, like Windows 10 rollout, to everyday issues such as new keyboard and mouse. I have experience in high-pressure situations. I have worked hands-on with Point-of-Sales systems with both hardware and software.
    Studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology is the first and most important step towards getting to this goal, as this degree not only covers technical aspects of IT but also has minor subjects in management. The position requires a degree in Technology and this course will take me roughly 5-6 years to complete. In terms of experience while I have 4 years of level 1/2 helpdesk experience this won’t be enough to step into a management role, with my current employer I will start taking on smaller management roles like planning and budgeting a new surveillance system with the help of my manager. To be better understand best practices I will be enrolling in an ITIL class toward the end of this degree to ensure that I am up to date. My current role has limitations both in the range of software used and size of the company to prepare me for 1500+ users, as a result, I will have to move to a new company as a level 2 Technical support with at least 500 users then after a few years move again to another company as a level 3 technician with around 1000 users. Only after this will I be ready to take on the role of IT Operations Manager.
