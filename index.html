<p>
My family on my Mum’s side is Australian born for at least 4 Generations and on my Dad’s side,<br>
 my Grandfather is Welsh and moved to Australia during World War Two when he was about 4.<br>
  My education so far is the completion of year 12 in 2014, where I went straight into university<br>
   at Victoria University to study Criminal Justice (Criminal Law cross with Sociology) as at the time<br>
    I wanted to join the Police, as the course went on I lost interest and when I was offered an IT job I <br>
    jumped at the opportunity and left Uni in 2016. I am an avid reader but only started this hobby since the first<br>
     lockdown in March 2020 and since then I have not stopped. I have read nearly 25 books in 18 months, <br>
     which is more than I have read leisurely than the rest of my life combine.
