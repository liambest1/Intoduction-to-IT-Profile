<h1> Project Idea</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A website that focuses on short live online classes at a cheap rate. The website will be called QuickClass. It will function between long-term online classes like that of online study at university and online video libraries with a quiz at the end such as linked in learning or Go1. This website will provide short 1-3 sessions per course in all kinds of hobbies, certification preparation, or workplace compliance. It will have assigned homework and corrected scores. This will be accessed mainly through a web browser but a companion mobile app will also be available for any text component. There will be one-on-one tutoring on specific subject areas regarding our provided classes.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The key motivator in the creation of this project is to assist people who struggle to do online learning without accountability or any ongoing assistance. There are currently dozens of e-learning platforms that provide educational videos and quizzes on a wide variety of topics and that number jumps into the hundreds if you count websites that have focused topics, but none of them offer live short courses in one-off webinars or boot camps. This website will include the recordings of the webinars and tests (unmarked) for a cheaper price for those that need a lower price. There will be an offer for enterprises licensing to then create an account for their employees to assist with all kinds of workplace compliance that can then be completed in groups in a conference room or individually from their homes.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The content is limited to courses that are no longer than 6 hours of live sessions with no more than 12 hours of homework (1 hour of class to 2 hours of homework). Most classes will be able to be completed in a single session including answering immediate questions. Classes can range from photography to how to use Microsoft products. This model allows users to learn a large variety of subjects in their free time from basics to advanced classes. Most hobby and skills-based classes will be offered in 3 levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate and advanced). Compliance-type classes such as work health and safety, Hygiene or bullying/harassment can be very short courses with teachers down to as short as 15 Minutes.
Personal accounts will be created with email, google account phone number Facebook account. Enterprise accounts have to be set up via the Employer, this will allow for single sign-on (SSO) and for content to be assigned to users for compliance purposes, this will also show the employer what courses you have completed if any are done outside of the required. The way personal accounts will access any content will be via registering to scheduled classes that would be set by the teacher e.g photoshop basics might be run four times a week at various times from midday to 9 PM allowing a variety of schedules. Each class will be booked ahead of time with a 20% deposit paid to ensure people turn up to booked time slots. For enterprise user accounts classes can be booked at no cost to the employee but has to be approved by an administrator as they will be charged, or a time group time can be organized at the convenience of the organizer.
A major component that will set this e-learning site apart from the others will be marked tests and assessments. This will provide a few advantages, first, it will assist those that are struggling with a particular topic. With all marked work submitted into our learning management system (LMS), there will be a review of the work done, with detail in both positive and negative aspects and will then allow re-submission with corrected work. Fully corrected work will allow for certificates based on work that requires submission beyond that of multiple questions. As none of the courses will be able to provide full industry-standard certificates all tests and assessments that are conducted will be done on computers with no ability to prevent cheating, making all marked work “open-book”.
This website will provide one-on-one tutoring by the teachers in pre-booked sessions at an extra cost. This will allow in-depth Q&A with teachers where ever required or even for a deeper understanding of the respective topic. These one-on-one sessions can only be limited to the topics related to the course and must be outlined at the booking time to else that the teacher can be prepared. While in all the classes there will be the opportunity for students to ask questions by voice or text in real-time the one-on-one sessions are more focused on not understanding key concepts or assignments. These bookings will be limited to 10 minutes so the main focus needs to be mentioned when applying for the session.
</p>

<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
<p>This project would require 30 TB of storage space for recorded video alone, if we run 100 classes a day will each going an average of 1.5 hours, with (at most) 1080P and only keeping footage for 3 months. There will be a requirement for at least 2 physical servers (one as a redundant of the first), this will be used for hosting our internal servers.  Each teacher will require and computer and camera of at least 720p or higher. I website to function as a Learning management system. A mobile application with limited functionality for android and iOS.
</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>The main skill for this project is web development as the website is the main medium for user engagement. This means a very high level of understanding of HTML. To a lesser extent, there will be a requirement for experienced app developers. The concept of e-learning and video storage isn’t new so finding people talented enough to be able to set up and maintain this set should not be difficult. Server hardware and storage drive might be expensive but very easy to obtain. The mobile applications will not have any complex features, it would mainly be for accessing reading materials.
</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>The main outcome, if this project is successful, will be providing individuals with a strong support network and guidance on short-term courses or just assist with new skills or hobbies. This project will also help companies ensure that all their staff have had the required training without shortcuts. This system should see more people approaching new skills or improving on skills they already use in their day-to-day.</p>
